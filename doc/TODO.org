#+TITLE: TODO
#+DESCRIPTION: 

A list of various ideas and things to be done for Thundersnow, so they aren't forgotten. Roughly in descending order of priority. Not an exhaustive list, of course.

* Specify a license
* Theming support
(this also depends on more theming functionality being implemented in McCLIM)
** Perhaps use [[https://codeberg.org/contrapunctus/clim-app-base/src/branch/production/doc/anathema.org][Anathema]]?
* Documentation
* File search pane (for loading samples, projects, etc)
** Use thumbnails if possible
* Command line interface
* MIDI controller support
* Routing GUI/"Session" support
* Make it actually look good (related to theming support, above)
* Create the universe
** Bake an apple pie from scratch
* Create a site
** Register a domain
* Integration with [[https://freesound.org/][Freesound]] -- maybe via [[https://github.com/ntrocado/freesound][ntrocado/freesound]]
* Integration with [[http://sox.sourceforge.net/][SoX]] to generate soundfile thumbnails (spectrograms):
~sox input.wav -n channels 1 spectrogram -r -o output.png~
** ffmpeg also supports generating thumbnails.
* Look into this page on [[http://www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ColorSch/Schemes.html][color schemes]]
* config file stuff
** Example config files
** According to the XDG it should probably be `(uiop:xdg-config-home "my-application" "init.lisp")` ...that's `~/.config/my-application/init.lisp` on my system (probably the same on all UNIX-likes; no idea about Windows).
** Consider using [[https://github.com/szos/defconfig][defconfig]] for customization/options/etc.
* Standalone mode
for when Thundersnow is started from the command line, not loaded from an already-running Lisp image.
* File indexer
for fast searching through sample/music directories.
* Playlist view
* MIDI mapping
* MIDI device interfacing (generalized functionality to send/receive MIDI to/from controllers to use them as an interface and display relevant info)
* Testing and distribution/packages
** [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/continuous-testing-and-packaging.org][Useful information from the Nyxt project]]
* EVERYTHING ELSE!
